# Ibus-I3wm-Guide

To restart Ibus:
```
ibus-daemon &
```

To see the current Ibus engine:
```
ibus engine
```

To list all the engine and knowing the one to be switched:
```
ibus list-engine
```
To choose the engine as your desire (In my case Ibus-Teni for Vietnamese typing):
```
ibus engine teni
```
